### Sparrows Have Changed Their Song

#### From triplet-ending to doublet-ending, how did this come to be?

A few days back, I came across an interesting study by the researchers at the
University of Northern British Columbia on how there has been a continent-wide
shift in song dialect of white-throated sparrows. This spread has also been
stated as one of the most viral phenomenons in bird kingdom so far. Let’s look
in brief what this research has to say.

The old sparrow song distinguished by its clean three-note ending was first
observed in the 1950s. Some say this has been a characteristic song of white
sparrows throughout North America for over a century. The Canadians also gave
these three-noted hook lyrics of “Oh my sweet, Ca-na-da, Ca-na-da, Ca-na-da.”
But starting from the 2000s, a novel song started to take the place of this
famous bird song.

Birds rarely change their tune, and when they do, it is limited to their region
and doesn’t travel very far. These songs may become their regional dialect at
best. Hypotheses on regional song variation (‘‘dialects’’) assume that dialects
remain stable within regions, are distinct between regions, and persist within
populations over extensive periods.

It would be considered atypical for a novel song variant to invade and replace
the established regional variant. But this recent study shows that there is an
exception to this rule where a new two-noted song sung by white-throated sparrow
is spreading at a very high rate crossing regions. What’s more interesting is
that this song is replacing the three-noted version of their song, which dates
back to the 1900s.

Why do birds sing? Male birds sing to mark territories. Well said by [David
Steadman](https://theconversation.com/profiles/david-steadman-775911), in Earth
Sky, a singing bird is saying, “This place is mine, and I’m willing to defend
it, especially from others of my species.” He may patrol his chosen space and
often sing, either from the middle of the edges of what he considers his turf.
Another purpose of singing is to attract mates and to check compatibility based
on the similarity of the song.

From recordings collected over two decades across North America, the research
led by Ken A. Otter shows that doublet-ending song has now spread at a
continental scale. This new song, which first started to appear around the
2000s, features a distinctive two-note ending more like, “Oh my sweet, Ca-na,
Ca-na, Ca-na.”

This new song is taking the sparrow groups by storm, and the reason for it being
so viral is still a mystery. The most probable answer seems to be that the song
invented by a single bird by accident spread through the local region based on
its attractiveness to other sparrows and then spread through different regions
of Canada.

> regional song type, as predicted by the indirect biased transmission hypothesis”

Research has helped in bringing about an all-embracing natural phenomenon of
tutoring. This suggests a potential mechanism for spread through song tutoring
on wintering grounds.

The long-existing three-note ending dialect of sparrows in Canada can now be
acknowledged to be on the verge of extinction as this new song gets more viral.
The research will go on to further understand if the female sparrows are more
responsive to this two-note tune compared to the historic three-noted one and if
that is the reason for replacement.
